![aboutMe](/images/abtme.jpg 'aboutMe')

This blog was initiated on a beautiful Friday in Manchester (UK) while I was pursuing an MSc in Quantitative finance at The University of Manchester. For a more specific context, the blog was built after I had finished my final exam in Time Series Econometrics. It was not bad enough for me to feel sad, but it was also not good enough to be hyped up. My emotion was something in the middle that I don't know which word can be used to describe. So let's call it a "doohickey" feeling. Nevertheless, this blog is not among my "distressed" activities after a "doohickey" day. Well, I can't eliminate it as one of my motivations, but this blog is my determination after careful thinking and consideration. 

Indeed, my embryo of this blog has been for like 2 years. I always want to have my blog, not to show off knowledge in my area of expertise (trust me!!!), but to enhance my writing skill. In my perspective, writing is not a thing but about logic. If you can deliver coherent and clear writing, you assimilate the knowledge. In other words, it becomes your asset rather than a tool to ace some exams. Espousing that idea, I tried to make a WordPress blog. But I have never written a proper post.

For many years after graduation, I was always busy at work. On average, I worked for 10 - 12 hours per day (even more), including weekends. I did not have proper time for myself, let alone blogging. Indeed, I forgot that I used to have that intention. Even now, I am having a break from working, returning to university for a master's degree. Now, I have nothing but time. However, the idea of blogging never comes to mind for a moment. A few days ago, when I was looking through my Facebook, I came across a response from my ex-colleague on a topic asking for advice to orientate their study in the field of economics. He mentioned his blog, where he shared his thoughts, experience and what he learned. That moment woke me up. He used to have the same idea as me about blogging, but he has done it for two years. Despite seldom making posts recently, he put real effort into it rather than thinking about it and blaming the context for postponing the blog as I have always done.
