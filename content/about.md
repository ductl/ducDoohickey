![aboutMe](/images/abtme.jpg 'aboutMe')

This blog was initiated on a beautiful Friday in Manchester (UK) while I was pursuing an MSc in Quantitative finance at The University of Manchester. For a more specific context, the blog was built after I had finished my final exam in Time Series Econometrics. It was not bad enough for me to feel sad, but it was also not good enough to be hyped up. My emotion was something in the middle that I don't know which word can be used to describe. So let's call it a "doohickey" feeling. Nevertheless, this blog is not among my "distressed" activities after a "doohickey" day. Well, I can't eliminate it as one of my motivations, but this blog is my determination after careful thinking and consideration. 

Indeed, my embryo of this blog has been for like 2 years. I always want to have my blog, not to show off knowledge in my area of expertise (trust me!!!), but to enhance my writing skill. In my perspective, writing is not a thing but about logic. If you can deliver coherent and clear writing, you assimilate the knowledge. In other words, it becomes your asset rather than a tool to ace some exams. Espousing that idea, I tried to make a WordPress blog. But I have never written a proper post.

For many years after graduation, I was always busy at work. On average, I worked for 10 - 12 hours per day (even more), including weekends. I did not have proper time for myself, let alone blogging. Indeed, I forgot that I used to have that intention. Even now, I am having a break from working, returning to university for a master's degree. Now, I have nothing but time. However, the idea of blogging never comes to mind for a moment. A few days ago, when I was looking through my Facebook, I came across a response from my ex-colleague on a topic asking for advice to orientate their study in the field of economics. He mentioned his blog, where he shared his thoughts, experience and what he learned. That moment woke me up. He used to have the same idea as me about blogging, but he has done it for two years. Despite seldom making posts recently, he put real effort into it rather than thinking about it and blaming the context for postponing the blog as I have always done. Now, you can tell the reason why I offcially start my blog. Yes, it is, "peer pressure"!

Well, again, I will not deny that reason. But I would like to say that I start my blog because I am getting old! As a matter of fact, I am turning 26 in this year (2023), I never have a Tiktok account and I don't understand why the youngster nowsaday is so interested in it? I listen to 2000s music and sometime 70s. Yep, I am an old man. But, the essential point of getting old is that you don't have much chance to "redo". Every single decisions about every facets of life made today will significantly shape your life in the next 40 years. At the age of 20, you have plenty of time to do a little bit here, a little bit there. If they are wrong, not suitable with your personality, you can easily move on for a fresh start over. However, when you arppoach 30s, time is not with your side anymore. You should have in your mind the image of the person who you want to be in this life or else, you might be lost amid this chaotic life.

So, my friend's blog, on one hand, exerts peer pressure on me. But moreover, it induces an epiphany moment in my mind. It is time to curb the spotaneous person inside me, slow down the pace of life to facilitate careful thinking. After years of working for different organization with variety of roles and resposibilities, I have accumulated knowledge and experience. It should be sufficient for me to identify the life that I want to embark on. Right now, I am having a break from working, I have plenty of free time to play video game from morning till late night like what I used to do when I was in highschool. So, besdies nurturing the child in me, I need to cogitate about my life. In my viewpoint, answering this existential question will help me have a full life without too much regrets.

Hence, writting blog is a good solution for many of my problems. Firstly, it will help reorganize every knowledge that I have had so far. It is also the test for my understanding of everything that I learnt. If I assimilate it, I can smoothly write it down and publish on my blog. If not, I can know about what pieces I am missing and what I need to reinforce and further develop. Secondly, a single piece of writing might take me hours or days sitting in front of desktop to think and jot it down. I don't understand why they are sudden tranquil moment in my life. I totally block my mind from other stuffs to have a serious conversation with my inner. It is my hobby rather a tool to sharpen my mind.

In this blog, you will find my post on topics on pure math and its application in the field of finance. I will upload my progress and solution to programming problems that I am often challenge myself. Certaintly, I will write about topics in finance and economics which is my domain of knowledge. And lastly, I will have post about funny things happened in my life or suddens idea that comes through my mind for some random moments. So, I hope you will enjoy reading my blog and hopefully, somehow, I can inspire you.

Normally, when I take up new thing, I will make a very big big annoucement to my friends. And then I do nothing! This time will be different. I siliently do everything. So if you are my friends or know me in person, and by some unfortune you land on my blog, then "F*ck you!!!".
